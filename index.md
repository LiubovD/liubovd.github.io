# 🐈 About Me

My name is Liubov "Luba" Dumarevskaya.

I started with *mosses and mountains* and ended up in *maps and models*.

As a trained **biologist-turned-GIS scientist**, I use data to understand how the environment affects both **ecosystems** and **communities**. After finishing my PhD researching **tree mortality** and **infrastructure resilience**, I’ve turned my attention to **human well-being**.

🌍 These days, I’m combining **demographic** and **public health datasets** to examine **who is most at risk** in the face of environmental change. It's work that connects **ecology to equity**—and it's grounded in **spatial science**.

🛰️ I still love getting outside and getting my boots dirty, but most days you’ll find me:
- 🧑‍💻 coding geospatial workflows,
- 🗺️ mapping environmental trends, or
- 👩‍🏫 helping others make sense of complex spatial problems.
